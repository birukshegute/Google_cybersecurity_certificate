## 🧪 Portfolio Project: Security Controls & Compliance Audit

As part of the course, I completed a mock **security audit** for a fictional company (Botium Toys). This included:

- 📋 Filling out a **Controls Assessment Checklist** to evaluate the presence of key security controls.
- ✅ Completing a **Compliance Best Practices Checklist** for:
  - PCI DSS
  - GDPR
  - SOC 1 & SOC 2
- 📝 Writing a brief set of recommendations to stakeholders on how to improve the organization’s security posture.

This project simulated a real-world scenario and helped build experience in risk evaluation and policy alignment.
