# 📘 Course 4: Tools of the Trade – Linux and SQL

This course introduces two essential tools in a cybersecurity analyst’s toolkit: the **Linux command line** and **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. These technologies are critical for navigating systems, investigating incidents, analyzing data, and performing routine security operations.

## ✅ What I Learned

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals

- Navigated Linux using the **command-line interface (CLI)**
- Worked with **directories**, **permissions**, and **files**
- Executed system commands using `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `chmod`, `chown`, and more
- Used `grep`, `cat`, `less`, and `head` to examine logs and filter output
- Practiced **file redirection**, piping, and working with wildcards
- Explored **process management** with `ps`, `top`, and `kill`

### 🛠️ Linux in Cybersecurity

- Used commands to monitor system activity and investigate logs
- Checked for signs of unauthorized access or configuration changes
- Reviewed system logs stored in `/var/log/` to identify anomalies

---

### 🗃️ SQL for Cybersecurity

- Learned basic and intermediate **SQL syntax**
- Queried databases to analyze event and user log data
- Practiced SQL operations:
  - `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`
  - Aggregations using `COUNT()`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`
  - Used subqueries and filtering techniques
- Retrieved and filtered data to identify security events (e.g., failed logins, suspicious IPs)

### 🧠 Analyst Thinking

- Used both Linux and SQL tools to:
  - Investigate anomalies
  - Trace event origins
  - Correlate system behavior with potential threats
