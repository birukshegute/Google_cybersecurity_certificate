# üõ°Ô∏è Course 4 Portfolio Project 2: Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## üìò Introduction

In this project, I acted as a security analyst investigating potential threats and anomalies in SQL logs. Using a variety of filtering techniques (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE`), I performed a deep analysis of login attempts and employee records. This helped identify security patterns and suspicious activities.

## üîç Query Results & Explanations

### 1. Retrieve After-Hours Failed Login Attempts

<br>

**Explanation:** Retrieves logins where `success = 0` and `login_time > '18:00'`, highlighting unusual failed attempts outside business hours.

---

### 2. Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates

<br>

**Explanation:** Filters logins on May 8 and 9, 2022 using the `OR` operator. These two days are of interest due to a suspected breach. The OR operator ensures both dates are checked.

---

### 3. Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico

<br>

**Explanation:** filters out all login attempts where the country column contains either "MEX" or "MEXICO". The NOT LIKE '%MEX%' ensures that any login from locations matching the pattern "MEX" is excluded, effectively showing only non-Mexico login attempts.

### 4. Retrieve Employees in Marketing in East Buildings

<br>

**Explanation:** Filters employees in the Marketing department working in offices that start with "East", like ‚ÄúEast-170‚Äù using `LIKE 'East%'`.

---

### 5. Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales

<br>

**Explanation:** Uses `OR` logic to get employees from both departments ‚Äî helpful for departmental audits.

### 6. Retrieve All Employees Not in IT

<br>

**Explanation:** Uses `NOT` to filter out employees in IT, useful for reviewing users pending system updates.

## üß† Summary

By applying SQL filters effectively, I was able to:

- Pinpoint login anomalies and potential breaches
- Narrow data to relevant departments and geographic regions
- Build queries to enhance security visibility and mitigate threats

---

## üìå Tools Used

- SQL
- Logical and pattern matching operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `LIKE`)
- Data visualization via query screenshots

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- SQL filtering helps isolate abnormal activity patterns
- Query logic is essential in investigations
- Clear documentation supports reproducibility and collaboration
