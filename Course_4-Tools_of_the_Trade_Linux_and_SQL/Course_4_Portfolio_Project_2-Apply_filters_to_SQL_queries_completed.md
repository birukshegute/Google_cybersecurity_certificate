# üõ°Ô∏è Course 4 Portfolio Project 2: Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## üìò Introduction

In this project, I acted as a security analyst investigating potential threats and anomalies in SQL logs. Using a variety of filtering techniques (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and `LIKE`), I performed a deep analysis of login attempts and employee records. This helped identify security patterns and suspicious activities.

**Explanation:** Retrieves logins where `success = 0` and `login_time > '18:00'`, highlighting unusual failed attempts outside business hours.

---

### 2. Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates
