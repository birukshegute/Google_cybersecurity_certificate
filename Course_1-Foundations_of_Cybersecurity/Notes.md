<details>
<summary>🧠 <strong>Key Terms</strong></summary>

- **Virus**: Malicious code that attaches itself to clean files and spreads.
- **Malware**: General term for software designed to cause harm to systems.

<summary>📜 <strong>Notable Early Cyber Attacks</strong></summary>

## 🧬 Brain Virus (1986)

- Created by the Alvi brothers to prevent software piracy.
- Spread via pirated floppy disks.
- Caused widespread global disruption — no data destruction.
- Demonstrated early need for cybersecurity planning.

## 🐛 Morris Worm (1988)

- Developed by Robert Morris as an experiment.
- Exploited vulnerabilities and reinstalled itself repeatedly.
- Crashed ~6,000 systems (10% of internet at the time).
- Led to the creation of CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams).

<summary>🌐 <strong>Modern Threats in the Digital Age</strong></summary>

## 💌 LoveLetter Virus (2000)

- Social engineering disguised as a romantic email.
- Spread via address books, infected 45 million systems.
- Created by Onel De Guzman to steal credentials.
- Damages: ~$10 billion.
- Showcased power of **phishing** + human vulnerability.

## 🏛️ Equifax Data Breach (2017)

- 143M+ records exposed (PII, SSNs, birthdates, etc.).
- Root cause: Unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability.
- Resulted in a $575M+ settlement.
- Reinforced importance of patching and vulnerability management.

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Social Engineering & Phishing</strong></summary>

- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to access private data.
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails/sites to steal data or install malware.
- Common due to:
  - Oversharing on social media.
  - Low security awareness.
  - High success rate with minimal effort.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <strong>Core Cybersecurity Concepts</strong></summary>

### 🔁 CIA Triad

The foundational model for cybersecurity principles:

- **Confidentiality** – Ensuring data is only accessible by authorized parties.
- **Integrity** – Guaranteeing data accuracy and protection from unauthorized modification.
- **Availability** – Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed.

### 🏅 CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)

- Industry-respected certification governed by (ISC)².
- Recognized globally for information security professionals.
- Not required for beginners, but referenced often in frameworks and standards.
- Covers 8 domains.

---

### 🔐 CISSP Security Domains

1. Security and Risk Management
2. Asset Security
3. Security Architecture and Engineering
4. Communication and Network Security
5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
6. Security Assessment and Testing
7. Security Operations
8. Software Development Security

---

### 🧩 Security Frameworks Mentioned

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Widely used model in the U.S. for risk-based cybersecurity.
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – International standard for managing information security.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>🔐 <strong>Responsibilities of Cybersecurity Professionals</strong></summary>

- Reduce organizational risk through system monitoring.
- Conduct phishing simulations and employee training.
- Communicate risks in a clear, business-oriented way.
- Stay current with evolving cyber threats and tactics.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧰 <strong>Cybersecurity Tools and Analyst Toolkit</strong></summary>

### 🛠️ Common Tools in an Analyst’s Toolkit

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**  
  Aggregates and analyzes logs to detect threats.  
  Offers dashboards, alerts, and customizable views.  
  Can be cloud-hosted or on-premise.

- **Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)**  
  Captures and inspects network traffic.  
  Useful for analyzing suspicious activity and understanding network behavior.

- **Playbooks**  
  Step-by-step guides for handling incidents and investigations.  
  Help ensure consistent, documented procedures across teams.

---

### 📚 Key Forensic Playbooks

- **Chain of Custody**  
  Ensures evidence integrity by tracking who accessed it, when, where, and why.

- **Protecting and Preserving Evidence**  
  Preserves fragile or volatile digital evidence by following the **Order of Volatility**, and working from forensic copies to avoid tampering.

---

### 💡 Takeaways

- Tools and playbooks vary by organization but serve the same core purpose: reducing risk and maintaining operational integrity.
- Analysts must understand not only **how to use tools**, but **why they are used** — especially during forensic investigations.

</details>

---

<details>
<summary>⚙️ <strong>Additional Tools and Technical Concepts</strong></summary>

### 💻 Programming Tools

- **Python** – Automates repetitive tasks and supports scripting for security operations.
- **SQL** – Interacts with and queries structured databases for forensic or log data.

### 🖥️ Operating Systems

- **Linux** – Open-source OS heavily used in cybersecurity environments.
- **macOS / Windows** – Also relevant depending on enterprise environments.
- Analysts use **command-line interfaces** to interact with systems directly.

---

### 🌐 Web & Network Security

- **Web Vulnerabilities** – Flaws in web apps that allow exploits (unauthorized access, malware, data theft).

  - Refer to [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for the most critical risks.

- **Antivirus Software** – Detects and removes malware.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** – Monitors network traffic and alerts on suspicious activity.
- **Encryption** – Secures data by converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.

---

### 🔍 Penetration Testing

- Simulates attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications.
- Helps organizations proactively strengthen their defenses.
