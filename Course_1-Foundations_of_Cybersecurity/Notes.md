<summary>📜 <strong>Notable Early Cyber Attacks</strong></summary>

### 🧬 Brain Virus (1986)

- Created by the Alvi brothers to prevent software piracy.
- Spread via pirated floppy disks.
- Caused widespread global disruption — no data destruction.
- Demonstrated early need for cybersecurity planning.

### 🐛 Morris Worm (1988)

- Developed by Robert Morris as an experiment.
- Exploited vulnerabilities and reinstalled itself repeatedly.
- Crashed ~6,000 systems (10% of internet at the time).
- Led to the creation of CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams).

<summary>🌐 <strong>Modern Threats in the Digital Age</strong></summary>

### 💌 LoveLetter Virus (2000)

- Social engineering disguised as a romantic email.
- Spread via address books, infected 45 million systems.
- Created by Onel De Guzman to steal credentials.
- Damages: ~$10 billion.
- Showcased power of **phishing** + human vulnerability.

### 🏛️ Equifax Data Breach (2017)

- 143M+ records exposed (PII, SSNs, birthdates, etc.).
- Root cause: Unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability.
- Resulted in a $575M+ settlement.
- Reinforced importance of patching and vulnerability management.

<details>
<summary>🎯 <strong>Social Engineering & Phishing</strong></summary>

- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to access private data.
- **Phishing**: Deceptive emails/sites to steal data or install malware.
- Common due to:
  - Oversharing on social media.
  - Low security awareness.
  - High success rate with minimal effort.

<details>
<summary>🔐 <strong>Responsibilities of Cybersecurity Professionals</strong></summary>

- Reduce organizational risk through system monitoring.
- Conduct phishing simulations and employee training.
- Communicate risks in a clear, business-oriented way.
- Stay current with evolving cyber threats and tactics.
